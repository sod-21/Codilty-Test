# Codilty-Test
Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(String S); }

that, given a string S consisting of N lowercase letters, returns the minimum number of letters that must be deleted to obtain a word in which every letter occurs a unique number of times. We only care about occurrences of letters that appear at least once in result.

Examples:

1. Given S = "aaaabbbb", the function should return 1. We can delete one occurrence of a or one occurrence of b. Then one letter will occur four times and the other one three times.

2. Given S = "ccaaffddecee", the function should return 6. For example, we can delete all occurrences of e and f and one occurrence of d to obtain the word "ccaadc". Note that both e and f will occur zero times in the new word, but that is fine, since we only care about letters that appear at least once.

3. Given S = "eeee", the function should return 0 (there is no need to delete any characters).

4. Given S = "example", the function should return 4.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [0..300,000];
string S consists only of lowercase letters (aâˆ’z).
